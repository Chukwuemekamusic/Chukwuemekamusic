# Hello, I'm Joseph! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a very passionate software developer with a keen interest in building innovative and impactful solutions. I am looking for opportunities to keep solving real life issues with my skill and grow as a developer. I'm driven by a desire to leverage my skills and expertise to create meaningful solutions that positively impact people's lives.

## About Me

- 🎓 I recently graduated with a Masters degree in IT from Robert Gordon University.
- 💻 I specialize in tackling coding algorithm challenges and FullStack software development, with expertise in Python, React, Nodejs, Django, SQL, noSQL, Tailwind...
- 🌱 I'm currently exploring building more project with the MERN stack, and have an interest in Machine Learning and AI with Python.

## Projects

Here are some highlights of my projects:

- [DiscussU frontend](https://github.com/Chukwuemekamusic/DiscussU-react_frontend): It is the frontend of a student engagement web application I built with ReactJS. It interacts with the backend API I also built using [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/Chukwuemekamusic/DiscussU). This was my MSc project that allows students view, create, join discussion rooms, follow other students within an institution.
- [Money Saver App](https://github.com/Chukwuemekamusic/money-saver-app): This app allows logged in users to create a saving plan and goal, with a weekly payment plan that adds up to the goal set for the plan. It also goes ahead to give a detailed saving summary and progress goal bar.
- [CLI Airline Booking System](https://github.com/Chukwuemekamusic/XYZ_AIRLINE_BOOKING): This is a command line simulation of a booking system of an airline using Python with Object-Oriented Programming to encapsulated the major codes.
